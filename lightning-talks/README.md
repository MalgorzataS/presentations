**18:15 - 18:20: Going down to South Park to make some tidy analysis (Patrik	Drhlík)**

Abstract:

South Park is a famous American TV show that tells a story of four nine year old boys. It is widely known as being very satiric and that most of the characters use lots of naughty words. In this talk, I will present my results of a text analysis done mostly using the R tidytext package by Julia Silge and David Robinson. The main question that I will answer is: Who is the naugthiest chracter in the series? Even those people who know the TV show will be surprised by the results. I will also show a simple sentiment analysis or episode popularity based on IMDB ratings. Do you think that the naughtiest episodes are more popular? We will find out.
